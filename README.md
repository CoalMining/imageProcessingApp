# imageProcessingApp  
This project was done as a partial requirement of GPGPU computing. I implemented some basic image processing algorithms to get hands on image processing.
The program was compiled and tested using MS Visual Studio 2015. A report can be found at  imageProcessingApp/Reportpp0030.pdf
